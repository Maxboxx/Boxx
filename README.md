# Boxx Library
The Boxx library is a header-only library for c++.

All code in the library is part of the `Boxx` namespace.

`Core.h` and `Types.h` are included by all files in the library. There is no need to explicitly include these headers when including other header files from the library. The rest of the headers should always be included explicitly.

A natvis file is included in the library to make debugging in Visual Studio easier.

Documentation for the library is available here: [https://maxboxx.com/cpp/boxx](https://maxboxx.com/cpp/boxx)
